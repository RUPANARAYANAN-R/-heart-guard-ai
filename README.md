## About The Project

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. Early detection and risk stratification are crucial for effective prevention and management. HeartGuard AI is a project designed to address this challenge by using a machine learning model to predict a patient's risk of heart disease based on a set of medical and demographic attributes.

This tool provides a simple REST API and an interactive dashboard for users to input patient data and receive an instant risk assessment. The core of this project is a trained classification model that has learned patterns from historical patient data.

**Dataset:** This model was trained on the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease), a well-known benchmark in the machine learning community.

## Key Features

‚ú® **High-Accuracy Prediction:** Utilizes a Gradient Boosting Classifier for robust and accurate risk prediction.
‚ú® **RESTful API:** A clean, fast, and scalable API built with FastAPI for easy integration into other applications.
‚ú® **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly web interface created with Streamlit for real-time predictions and data visualization.
‚ú® **Feature Importance:** Provides insights into which factors are most influential in predicting heart disease risk.
‚ú® **Containerized:** Docker support for easy setup, deployment, and scalability.

## How It Works

The architecture separates the offline training process from the online prediction service. This text-based flowchart is guaranteed to render correctly on GitHub.

**Offline Training Pipeline:**
[Raw Dataset]  -->  [1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing]  -->  [2. Model Training]  -->  [Saved Model File]


**Online Prediction Pipeline:**
[User Input]  -->  [FastAPI Backend]  -->  [Load Saved Model]  -->  [Make Prediction]  -->  [Display Result]


---

## Technology Stack

This project is built with modern, open-source technologies.

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Dashboard:** Streamlit
- **Deployment:** Docker, Uvicorn
- **Code Quality:** Black, isort

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.9+ and `pip`
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/heartguard-ai.git](https://github.com/your-username/heartguard-ai.git)
    cd heartguard-ai
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    (No changes are needed in `.env` for the default setup, but you can configure API ports here.)

## Usage

### Running the API

To start the FastAPI server, run the following command from the root directory:
```sh
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000. You can access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Running the Dashboard
To launch the Streamlit dashboard, run:

Bash

streamlit run dashboard.py
The dashboard will open in your web browser, usually at http://localhost:8501.

Using Docker (Optional)
Build and run the application using Docker Compose for a containerized setup.

Bash

docker-compose up --build
This will start both the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend.

Model Training
To train the model from scratch, you can run the training script. The script will process the data from the data/ directory, train the model, evaluate it, and save the final model artifact to the models/ directory.

Bash

python scripts/train_model.py
API Endpoints
The primary endpoint for prediction is:

POST /predict

Description: Accepts patient data and returns a heart disease risk prediction.

Body (JSON):

JSON

{
  "age": 52,
  "sex": 1,
  "cp": 0,
  "trestbps": 125,
  "chol": 212,
  "fbs": 0,
  "restecg": 1,
  "thalach": 168,
  "exang": 0,
  "oldpeak": 1.0,
  "slope": 2,
  "ca": 2,
  "thal": 3
}
Success Response (200):

JSON

{
  "prediction": 0,
  "prediction_label": "No Disease",
  "probability": 0.92
}
Where prediction: 0 means low risk and prediction: 1 means high risk.
